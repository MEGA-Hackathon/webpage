                    <h1>About</h1>
                    <p>We are a collective of east coast-based high school students interested in computer science. Competition provides a core aspect of computer science and programming at the high school level, providing students with an opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals, gain knowledge and experience relative to the subject, and test their ability in a low-stakes environment. However, during our search for hackathons to compete in, we found our selection quite underwhelming. Therefore, we set out to create a hackathon catering to and hosted by high school students.</p>
                    <p>The MEGA hackathon is a seasonal hackathon focusing on the United Nation's seventeen goals, aiming to improve human development by providing access to health care and education while protecting the environment. We believe that by infusing computer science with these goals, we can raise awareness for global issues while providing a stimulating experience for computer science students.</p>
