                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>We, at MEGA, are several high-school students interested in computer science-related competitions on the East Coast. However, during our search for hackathons to compete in, we found our selection quite underwhelming. Therefore, we have created a hackathon catered towards and hosted by high-school students.</p>
                <p>The MEGA hackathon (acronym unknown yet) is a seasonal hackathon that will constantly cater its topics around the United Nationâ€™s seventeen goals aimed for better human development:  bettering health, education, and environment. We believe that by infusing computer-science competitions with these goals, we can raise awareness for global welfares while providing a motivating passion for computer-science students.</p>
